# Divvy Data Wrangle, Analyze, and Visualize with Python

Welcome to the GitHub repo for my Divvy Data Analysis Report. You can check the analysis report in my Streamlit web app here: [https://divvy-data-analysis-report.streamlit.app](https://divvy-data-analysis-report.streamlit.app)

I used Divvy Bikes public data [https://divvybikes.com/system-data](https://divvybikes.com/system-data) to create the analysis report. The goal is to analyze the differences between members and casual riders throughout the year of 2022.

The original data has been made available under this license: [https://divvybikes.com/system-data](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

Divvy trip data from January 2022 to December 2022 were cleaned, transformed and analyzed using Python libraries like numpy and pandas. As for the data visualizations, bokeh and pydeck were used (all visualizations in the Streamlit web app are interactive).
